### Step 5: Configure Google Maps Scraper

Now use your Decodo proxy credentials with the Google Maps Scraper:

```bash
./google-maps-scraper \
  -input example-queries.txt \
  -results restaurants.csv \
  -proxies 'http://your_username:your_password@your_proxy_endpoint:port' \
  -depth 1 \
  -c 2
```

**Example with actual Decodo proxy format:**
```bash
./google-maps-scraper \
  -input example-queries.txt \
  -results restaurants.csv \
  -proxies 'http://user123:pass456@isp.decodo.com:10001' \
  -depth 1 \
  -c 2
```

## Proxy Configuration Examples

### HTTP Proxy
```bash
-proxies 'http://your_username:your_password@isp.decodo.com:'
```

### HTTPS Proxy
```bash
-proxies 'https://your_username:your_password@proxy.decodo.com:8443'
```

### Multiple Proxies (Load Balancing)
```bash
-proxies 'http://username:password@proxy1.decodo.com:8080,http://username:password@isp.decodo.com:10001'
```

## Complete Setup Example

Here's a complete walkthrough from setup to scraping with Decodo proxies:

### Prerequisites
- Google Maps Scraper installed (either binary or Docker)
- Decodo account with active proxy credentials
- Input file with search queries

### Step-by-Step Execution

1. **Prepare your queries file** (`example-queries.txt`):
```
restaurants in New York
hotels in London  
coffee shops in Tokyo
```

2. **Get your Decodo proxy details** from your dashboard:
- Username: `your_username`
- Password: `your_password` 
- Endpoint: `host:port`

3. **Run the scraper with Decodo proxy**:
```bash
# Basic scraping with Decodo proxy
./google-maps-scraper \
  -input example-queries.txt \
  -results decodo-results.csv \
  -proxies 'http://your_username:your_password@isp.decodo.com:10001' \
  -depth 5 \
  -c 4 \
  -exit-on-inactivity 5m

# With email extraction enabled
./google-maps-scraper \
  -input example-queries.txt \
  -results decodo-results-with-emails.csv \
  -proxies 'http://your_username:your_password@isp.decodo.com:10002' \
  -email \
  -depth 3 \
  -c 2 \
  -exit-on-inactivity 10m

# JSON output format
./google-maps-scraper \
  -input example-queries.txt \
  -results decodo-results.json \
  -proxies 'http://your_username:your_password@isp.decodo.com:10001' \
  -json \
  -depth 3 \
  -c 3
```

4. **Monitor the output**:

# Create results file
touch decodo-results.csv

# Run with Docker and Decodo proxy
docker run \
  -v $PWD/example-queries.txt:/example-queries \
  -v $PWD/decodo-results.csv:/results.csv \
  gosom/google-maps-scraper \
  -input /example-queries \
  -results /results.csv \
  -proxies 'http://your_username:your_password@isp.decodo.com:10001' \
  -depth 3 \
  -c 2 \
  -exit-on-inactivity 5m

# Run with Docker and Multiple Decodo proxies
docker run \
  -v $PWD/example-queries.txt:/example-queries \
  -v $PWD/decodo-results.csv:/results.csv \
  gosom/google-maps-scraper \
  -input /example-queries \
  -results /results.csv \
  -proxies 'http://your_username:your_password@isp.decodo.com:10001,http://your_username:your_password@isp.decodo.com:10001' \
  -depth 3 \
  -c 2 \
  -exit-on-inactivity 5m
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Rotation Strategy
- Use multiple proxy endpoints for better distribution
- Rotate proxies to avoid rate limiting
- Monitor proxy performance and switch if needed

### 2. Geographic Targeting
- Choose proxy locations that match your target regions
- Use local proxies for better Google Maps results accuracy
- Consider time zones when scraping location-specific data

### 3. Performance Optimization
- Start with lower concurrency (-c 2) when testing
- Gradually increase concurrency based on proxy performance
- Monitor response times and adjust accordingly

### 4. Error Handling
- Implement retry logic for failed requests
- Monitor for IP blocks or rate limits
- Have backup proxies ready

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Connection Errors**
- Verify proxy credentials are correct
- Check if proxy endpoint is accessible
- Ensure proper URL formatting

**Authentication Failures**
- Double-check username and password
- Verify account is active and has credits
- Contact Decodo support if issues persist

**Performance Issues**
- Try different proxy locations
- Reduce concurrency level
- Check network connectivity

### Testing Your Decodo Proxy

Before running large scraping jobs, test your proxy connection:

```bash
# Test with a single query and minimal depth
./google-maps-scraper \
  -input test-query.txt \
  -results test-results.csv \
  -proxies 'http://your_username:your_password@premium.decodo.com:8080' \
  -depth 1 \
  -c 1 \
  -debug
```

Expected successful output:
```
‚úì Proxy connection established: premium.decodo.com:8080
‚úì Google Maps loaded successfully
‚úì Processing query: test restaurant
‚úì Found 10 results, extracting...
```
