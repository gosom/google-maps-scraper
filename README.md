## What Google maps scraper does

A command line and web based google maps scraper build using 

[scrapemate](https://github.com/gosom/scrapemate) web crawling framework.

You can use this repository either as is, or you can use its code as a base and
customize it to your needs

![Example GIF](img/example.gif)

### Web UI:

```
mkdir -p gmapsdata && docker run -v $PWD/gmapsdata:/gmapsdata -p 8080:8080 gosom/google-maps-scraper -data-folder /gmapsdata
```

Or dowload the [binary](https://github.com/gosom/google-maps-scraper/releases) for your platform and run it.

Note: The results will take at least 3 minutes to appear, even if you add only one keyword. This is the minimum configured runtime.

Note: for MacOS the docker command should not work. **HELP REQUIRED**

You can download a MacOs App version here: https://github.com/melogabriel/google-maps-scraper/releases/tag/MacOs-v1.0.0 


### Command line:

```
touch results.csv && docker run -v $PWD/example-queries.txt:/example-queries -v $PWD/results.csv:/results.csv gosom/google-maps-scraper -depth 1 -input /example-queries -results /results.csv -exit-on-inactivity 3m
```

file `results.csv` will contain the parsed results.

**If you want emails use additionally the `-email` parameter*

### REST API
The Google Maps Scraper provides a RESTful API for programmatic management of scraping tasks.

### Key Endpoints

- POST /api/v1/jobs: Create a new scraping job
- GET /api/v1/jobs: List all jobs
- GET /api/v1/jobs/{id}: Get details of a specific job
- DELETE /api/v1/jobs/{id}: Delete a job
- GET /api/v1/jobs/{id}/download: Download job results as CSV

For detailed API documentation, refer to the OpenAPI 3.0.3 specification available through Swagger UI or Redoc when running the app https://localhost:8080/api/docs

## Features

- Extracts many data points from google maps
- Exports the data to CSV, JSON or PostgreSQL 
- Performance about 120 urls per minute (-depth 1 -c 8)
- Extendable to write your own exporter
- Dockerized for easy run in multiple platforms
- Scalable in multiple machines
- Optionally extracts emails from the website of the business
- SOCKS5/HTTP/HTTPS proxy support
- Serverless execution via AWS Lambda functions (experimental & no documentation yet)
- Fast Mode (BETA)

## Notes on email extraction

By default email extraction is disabled. 

If you enable email extraction (see quickstart) then the scraper will visit the 
website of the business (if exists) and it will try to extract the emails from the
page.

For the moment it only checks only one page of the website (the one that is registered in Gmaps). At some point, it will be added support to try to extract from other pages like about, contact, impressum etc. 


Keep in mind that enabling email extraction results to larger processing time, since more
pages are scraped. 

## Fast Mode

Fast mode returns you at most 21 search results per query ordered by distance from the **latitude** and **longitude** provided.
All the results are within the specified **radius**

It does not contain all the data points but basic ones. 
However it provides the ability to extract data really fast. 

When you use the fast mode ensure that you have provided:
- zoom
- radius (in meters)
- latitude
- longitude


**Fast mode is Beta, you may experience blocking**

## Quickstart

### Using docker:

```
touch results.csv && docker run -v $PWD/example-queries.txt:/example-queries -v $PWD/results.csv:/results.csv gosom/google-maps-scraper -depth 1 -input /example-queries -results /results.csv -exit-on-inactivity 3m
```

file `results.csv` will contain the parsed results.

**If you want emails use additionally the `-email` parameter**


### On your host

(tested only on Ubuntu 22.04)


```
git clone https://github.com/gosom/google-maps-scraper.git
cd google-maps-scraper
go mod download
go build
./google-maps-scraper -input example-queries.txt -results restaurants-in-cyprus.csv -exit-on-inactivity 3m
```

Be a little bit patient. In the first run it downloads required libraries.

The results are written when they arrive in the `results` file you specified

**If you want emails use additionally the `-email` parameter**

```

## Using a custom writer

In cases the results need to be written in a custom format or in another system like a db a message queue or basically anything the Go plugin system can be utilized.

Write a Go plugin (see an example in examples/plugins/example_writeR.go) 

Compile it using (for Linux):

```
go build -buildmode=plugin -tags=plugin -o ~/mytest/plugins/example_writer.so examples/plugins/example_writer.go
```

and then run the program using the `-writer` argument. 

See an example:

1. Write your plugin (use the examples/plugins/example_writer.go as a reference)
2. Build your plugin `go build -buildmode=plugin -tags=plugin -o ~/myplugins/example_writer.so plugins/example_writer.go`
3. Download the lastes [release](https://github.com/gosom/google-maps-scraper/releases/) or build the program
4. Run the program like `./google-maps-scraper -writer ~/myplugins:DummyPrinter -input example-queries.txt`


### Plugins and Docker

It is possible to use the docker image and use tha plugins.
In such case make sure that the shared library is build using a compatible GLIB version with the docker image.
otherwise you will encounter an error like:

```
/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.32' not found (required by /plugins/example_writer.so)
```


## Using Database Provider (postgreSQL)

For running in your local machine:

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yaml up -d
```

The above starts a PostgreSQL container and creates the required tables

to access db:

```
psql -h localhost -U postgres -d postgres
```

Password is `postgres`

Then from your host run:

```
go run main.go -dsn "postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/postgres" -produce -input example-queries.txt --lang el
```

(configure your queries and the desired language)

This will populate the table `gmaps_jobs` . 

you may run the scraper using:

```
go run main.go -c 2 -depth 1 -dsn "postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/postgres"
```

If you have a database server and several machines you can start multiple instances of the scraper as above.

### Kubernetes

You may run the scraper in a kubernetes cluster. This helps to scale it easier.

Assuming you have a kubernetes cluster and a database that is accessible from the cluster:

1. First populate the database as shown above
2. Create a deployment file `scraper.deployment`

```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: google-maps-scraper
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: google-maps-scraper
  replicas: {NUM_OF_REPLICAS}
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: google-maps-scraper
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: google-maps-scraper
        image: gosom/google-maps-scraper:v0.9.3
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        args: ["-c", "1", "-depth", "10", "-dsn", "postgres://{DBUSER}:{DBPASSWD@DBHOST}:{DBPORT}/{DBNAME}", "-lang", "{LANGUAGE_CODE}"]
```

Please replace the values or the command args accordingly 

Note: Keep in mind that because the application starts a headless browser it requires CPU and memory. 
Use an appropriate kubernetes cluster

## Telemetry

Anonymous usage statistics are collected for debug and improvement reasons. 
You can opt out by setting the env variable `DISABLE_TELEMETRY=1`

## Performance

Expected speed with concurrency of 8 and depth 1 is 120 jobs/per minute.
Each search is 1 job + the number or results it contains.

Based on the above: 
if we have 1000 keywords to search with each contains 16 results => 1000 * 16 = 16000 jobs.

We expect this to take about 16000/120 ~ 133 minutes ~ 2.5 hours

If you want to scrape many keywords then it's better to use the Database Provider in
combination with Kubernetes for convenience and start multiple scrapers in more than 1 machines.
