---

A powerful command-line Google Maps scraper built upon the original [gosom/google-maps-scraper](https://github.com/gosom/google-maps-scraper), enhanced with additional features for more versatile scraping tasks.

## üöÄ New Features

- **Json Input for Polygon to H3 Conversion**: Import geographic shapes directly in JSON format and convert them to H3 indices for precise location searches.
- **Proxy Support**: Enable scraping through proxies to bypass IP restrictions and enhance anonymity.
- **Search by Latitude/Longitude**: Perform searches using specific coordinates, allowing for targeted data collection based on geographical locations.
- **Bug Fixes**: Addressed issues related to saving entries to PostgreSQL databases, ensuring reliable data storage.
- **Click Reject Find Home**: Implement a mechanism to automatically reject homepages during scraping, focusing on relevant search results.
- **Refactoring and API Enhancements**: Streamlined codebase for improved performance and introduced new APIs for extended customization and control over scraping operations.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/enhanced-google-maps-scraper.git cd enhanced-google-maps-scraper

### Build and Run

Ensure Go is installed on your system. Then, build and run the scraper:
go build ./enhanced-google-maps-scraper -input example-queries.json -results results.csv -proxy http://your-proxy:8080 -lat-long "@10.7773285,106.6864011,18z"

Replace `http://your-proxy:8080` with your actual proxy details and adjust the latitude/longitude parameters as needed.

## üìÅ Example Queries

Create a file named `example-queries.json` with the following content to test the polygon to H3 conversion feature:
json [ { "query": "Ph·ªü", "polygon": [ [-122.4194, 37.7749], [-122.4194, 37.7799], [-122.4294, 37.7799], [-122.4294, 37.7749] ] } ]

This example demonstrates how to search for "Ph·ªü" within a specific area defined by a polygon.
